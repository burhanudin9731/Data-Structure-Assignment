DFS Application:
1. Finding Connected Components (Clusters)
2. Cycle Detection - detects cycles in directed and undirected graphs
3. Topological Sorting - orders tasks based on dependencies
4. Path Finding and maze solving - explores all possible paths
5. Tree traversals - inorder,preorder, postorder traversals
6. Artificial Intelligence - used in game trees.


  BFS Application:
1. Shortest Path in Unweighted Graphs - find the shortest number of edges
2. Level Order Traversal of Trees  - traverses tree level by level
3. Bipartite Graph Checking - determine whether graph can be divided into two sets
4. Web Crawlers - Crawls web pages level by level
5. Broadcasting in Networks - used in packet routing for communication
6. Shortest Path in Grids and Mazes - for robot navigation





🔹 DFS (Depth First Search)

📌 Definition
DFS is a graph traversal technique where we start from a node and explore as deep as possible before backtracking.

DFS uses:

Stack (explicitly or via recursion)

📌 DFS Algorithm (Steps)

Start from a source node

Mark it as visited

Visit an unvisited adjacent node

Repeat until no unvisited node remains

Backtrack



//DFS EXAMPLE

#include <stdio.h>

int visited[10];

void DFS(int graph[10][10], int n, int v) {
    int i;
    visited[v] = 1;
    printf("%d ", v);

    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if(graph[v][i] == 1 && !visited[i]) {
            DFS(graph, n, i);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 4;
    int graph[10][10] = {
        {0,1,1,0},
        {1,0,0,1},
        {1,0,0,1},
        {0,1,1,0}
    };

    DFS(graph, n, 0);
    return 0;
}




🔹 BFS (Breadth First Search)
📌 Definition
BFS is a graph traversal technique where we explore all neighboring nodes first, level by level.

BFS uses:

Queue

📌 BFS Algorithm (Steps)

Start from source node

Enqueue it and mark as visited

Dequeue a node and visit its neighbors

Enqueue unvisited neighbors

Repeat until queue is empty



//BFS EXAMPLE

#include <stdio.h>

int visited[10], queue[10], front = -1, rear = -1;

void BFS(int graph[10][10], int n, int start) {
    int i;
    queue[++rear] = start;
    visited[start] = 1;

    while(front != rear) {
        int v = queue[++front];
        printf("%d ", v);

        for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if(graph[v][i] == 1 && !visited[i]) {
                queue[++rear] = i;
                visited[i] = 1;
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 4;
    int graph[10][10] = {
        {0,1,1,0},
        {1,0,0,1},
        {1,0,0,1},
        {0,1,1,0}
    };

    BFS(graph, n, 0);
    return 0;
}
